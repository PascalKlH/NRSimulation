Introduction
This project simulates the growth of crops and the management of weeds in agricultural fields. It allows users to input parameters related to planting and manage the growth process through a structured simulation. The results can be analyzed and visualized using various data analysis techniques.

Features
Dynamic simulation of crop growth based on user-defined parameters.
Support for multiple planting types (grid, alternating, random).
Weed growth simulation and management.
Data storage in SQLite for easy retrieval and analysis.
Visualization of simulation results using Plotly.
Integration with Django for web-based interface.
Technologies Used
Python
Django
SQLite
NumPy
Pandas
Plotly
JSON
Bootstrap (for front-end styling)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (optional):

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Use the web interface to input the simulation parameters (e.g., start date, number of iterations, step size).
Choose the planting configuration (e.g., plant types, strip widths) and run the simulation.
View the results, which are stored in the database and can be visualized.

Models Overview
DataModelInput
Stores input parameters for the simulation, including start date, number of iterations, step size, and row length.

RowDetail
Contains details about each row in the simulation, including plant type, planting method, strip width, and row spacing.

DataModelOutput
Holds output data from the simulation, including time, yield, growth, water levels, overlaps, and other relevant data.

DataModelOutputDetails
Stores detailed output data in JSON format for comprehensive analysis.

Running the Simulation
The simulation can be initiated through the web interface after inputting the necessary parameters.
The simulation runs for the specified duration, managing crop growth and weed growth in parallel.
Results are recorded in the SQLite database for later analysis.
